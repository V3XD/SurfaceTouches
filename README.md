# SurfaceTouches
Visualizes multiple touches on PixelSense (Surface 2.0).
Receives TouchDown, TouchUp and TouchMove events from a Surface app through UDP messages.

Surface app: https://github.com/V3XD/SurfaceUDP

## Known issues
The Unity3D app freezes unless there is mouse movement and the cursor needs to be visible.
We recommend using the [Mouse Jiggler](https://mousejiggler.codeplex.com/).
